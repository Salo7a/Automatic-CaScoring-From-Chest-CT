# Coronary Artery Disease Scoring Suit For 3D Slicer

A loadable module for 3D Slicer Platform written 
in python, with a flask server for easy deployment 
on cloud computing services.

## Intro


Our main goal is to provide a tool that automates heart scans (coronary calcium scans) and calculate the Agatston score, which reflects the total area of calcium deposits and the density of the calcium, using a simple and user friendly interface in a short amount of time, the score could then be used with other health information to assess the overall health and risk of heart disease, this could be helpful in both research and clincal settings, the first step was to calculate the volume of the calcified plaques in the Coronary Artery.

This volume, also known as calcium score, is one of the risk factors used to
predict the likelihood of Coronary Artery Disease Events occurring in the next few years,
this process is currently being done manually by Radiologists.

This is what motivated us to make this extension, as way to help make this process
better, more streamlined, and make it easier to combine it with other data to better predict heart diseases as there is currently no widespread free tool that helps on this front.

## Requirements

### For The Extension
`scikit-image tensorflow`

*Installed Automatically By The Extension In Slicer's 
Packaged Python*

The Slicer Module [SlicerProcesses](https://github.com/pieper/SlicerProcesses) is required 
and comes pre-packaged with the extension

### For The Server
`flask scikit-image tensorflow pillow`

A requirements file for easy setup is included and can be found 
[here](flask-server/requirements.txt).

# The Main Module's Features

Our Main Module, The **CaScoreModule** has two main 
operation modes:

1. Local Mode: The data is processed locally on the user's machine,
note that for optimal performance, a system capable of running
   TensorFlow Models is needed, A CUDA-Capable GPU will increase performance
   drastically, TensorFlow and other required packages needs to be installed 
   inside Slicer's Packaged Python, A check will be done during first operation
   in this mode and all the required packages will be automatically installed.
   
2. Online Mode: The data is processed online, the volume is sent to a given URL
which will process the data and send it back, an example server is included in
   this repo together with a requirements file.
   
The Module's widget is divided into 6 main sections which helps
the user in selecting the settings they need and also see the progress &
the results. These sections are:

## Input Volume Select

![Input Volume Select](Images/Volume%20Select.png)

In this section, we simply select which one of the loaded 
volumes will we do the processing on

## General Settings

![General Settings](Images/General%20Settings.png)

In this section, we select the main parameters for our processing:

### Processing Location

We have two main modes in our module, a local mode and an online mode,
This setting determines which one we will use, in summary the difference
between them is:

1. Local Mode: The data is processed locally on the user's machine,
   note that for optimal performance, a system capable of running
   TensorFlow Models is needed, A CUDA-Capable GPU will increase performance
   drastically, TensorFlow and other required packages needs to be installed 
   inside Slicer's Packaged Python, A check will be done during first operation
   in this mode and all the required packages will be automatically installed.
   
2. Online Mode: The data is processed online, the volume is sent to a given URL
   which will process the data and send it back, an example server is included in
   this repo together with a requirements file.
   
### Cropping

This setting enables cropping, it uses the results of a Deep Learning
model built using TensorFlow to segment the heart, determining its location,
then we create a bounding box around the ROI (The Heart) predicted by the model and
crop out everything outside it.

### Partial Segmentation

This enables the Partial Segmentation mode, in this mode we select the three middle
slices from the Axial, Sagittal & Coronal views and use them to get the bounding box's 
coordinates used in cropping, while it's not as accurate or useful as segmenting 
the whole volume, it's role shines as a pre-processing step, this rough cropping 
could be done before segmenting the whole volume to increase its quality, or decrease
the volume's size which is useful in cases of using the online mode in a low or limited
internet bandwidth setting.

### Create A Heart Segmentation Node

Create a Segmentation node from the results of the full heart segmentation, enabling this 
disables the partial segmentation option, this segmentation is shown over the input heart
CT image and shows the location of the heart, it could also be converted into a closed
surface representation of the heart. This option is required to find calcifications.

### Visualize The Heart As A Closed Surface

Creates a closed surface representation of the heart's segmentation, this creates a 3D view
of the heart which could have numerous benefits, this option requires the full volume 
segmentation and the creation of a segmentation node.

### Find Calcifications And Create A Segmentation Node

Uses one of two available methods to find calcifications in the heart and save it in a 
segmentation node, by default uses Image Processing techniques to determine the calcification
the calculates their total volume. Requires full heart segmentation.

The image processing option uses image thresholding (>130-160) to find all locations 
containing calcium in the volume and saving it in a Calcifications volume, we then use it
to get two different volume:

1. Calcifications in the heart's segmentation area, this is done by masking the calcifications 
   using the heart segmentation prediction, so only calcification inside our
   predicted heart are detected.
   
2. Ignoring calcifications in the calcifications volume which are located near known bone masses.

By adding these two, we create a new volume which accurately locates all calcifications.

### Visualize The Heart As A Closed Surface

Creates a closed surface representation of the calcifications, similar to that of the heart.

### Use A Deep Learning Model To Find Calcifications

Using this option utilizes a TensorFlow Deep Learning Model to predict the location of 
calcifications.

### Use A Separate Process For Intensive Operations

This option delegates long-running operation to a separate process so that it doesn't block 
3D Slicer's UI.

This is a problem that plagues parts of 3D Slicer as it mainly works in a single-thread so any 
long-running or CPU intensive operations completely locks out the user from using the ui.

We choose to use a separate process instead of a second thread for a couple of reasons which are:

1. Using a different process for CPU-Intensive operations is generally preferred as it is faster
   than using threads, threads are better suited for I/O operations or any operation that simply 
   involves waiting, since the main operation that we delegate is model prediction which could 
   utilize the CPU heavily, running it in a separate process seemed more practical.
   
2. Due to the way 3D Slicer is built, and the fact that it runs on a pre-packaged python version
   and relies on it heavily to complete various operations (Even though 3D slicer is made using C++),
   threads are incompatible with it to a certain degree, to be able to use threads certain actions
   need to be made which could destabilize the application making it more error prone and prevent 
   the usage of some functionalities temporarily, this was a point against using threads even though
   it's generally easier to use them inside Qt.
   
## Local Processing

![Local Processing Settings](Images/Local%20Processing.png)

These settings are only available when using the local mode

### Heart Segmentation Model

Path to the folder containing the TensorFlow model used in the heart's segmentation,
we have one already provided which can be downloaded, but any model would work.

### Calcifications Model

Path to the folder containing the TensorFlow model used in detecting calcifications.

`There is currently no available demo model with reasonable output for calcifications detection provided`

## Online Processing

![Online Processing Settings](Images/Online%20Processing.png)

These settings are only available when using the online mode.

### Server URL

URL of the server to send the data to for processing, a demo server is provided

### Don't Request Segmentation

Only available during the partial segmentation mode, returns the bounding box coordinates instead
of returning the segmented slices and calculating the coordinates locally

### Anonymize Data

Removes any possible patient personal information before sending the volume to the server,
currently can't be disabled but this could change in the future when some information,
such as age and sex, could be used as parameters to help more in diagnosis.

## Progress

## Future Work

* Identify and segemnt the coronary artery into parts.
* Calculate the calcium denstiy.
* Calculate the Agatston score.
* Make exporting the results easier.
* Add more heart-related tests & ability to input patient health information, and using all of this data to better predict -and hopefully prevent- heart diseases.
